This is a drumline cadence I originally wrote in 1998.

I have organized it here to produce both a score with all instruments, as well as music for each instrument separately.

The actual music portion of each instrument is written in files with just the name of the instrument, i.e. `snare.ly`, `tenors.ly`, `bass.ly` and `cymbals.ly`

To create a pdf of the score, run
```
lilypond StreetBeat98.ly
```

To create a pdf of an individual instrument, e.g. the snare drum, run
```
lilypond StreetBeat98-snare.ly
```
