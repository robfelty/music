This is a place for me to store and share songs that I create, and tools to help make nice sheet music.

I am using Lilypond to make sheet music. 

The `lib` directory contains some general files to be included in other songs, which sets some preferences that I like

In particular, I have some settings suitable for writing marching drumming music, with some custom DrumTables

I also re-created the style of Carmine Appice's famous book "Realistic Rock", which uses a three line staff, which makes reading drumset music much simpler.
